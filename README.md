# `todospring`

This repository will host a CLI tool I am building which allows me to add comments to my code in a simple format that can be extracted in a Git hook and used to create corresponding issues in an external issue tracker. The comment will then be replaced (or at least updated) with a link to this derived issue so that it is not forgotten about.

I am also piloting a new approach at building utilities with reusable compositions.
